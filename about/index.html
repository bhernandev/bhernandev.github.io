<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a second-generation Filipino American, or first-generation if you're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrant_generations">one of those</a>. I absolutely love technology and the role it plays in our current and future society. I have a bachelor's in computer science from the genuinely incredible CUNY Hunter College and am currently pursuing a master's in data science from TBD.
