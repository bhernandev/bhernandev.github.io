I've been using DoorDash regularly for the past \~5 months because of the Covid-19 outbreak. Now, after all that time, I noticed that my text messages were filled with photos from my DoorDash drivers. For the uninitiated, some DoorDash drivers will text you pictures of your orders for confirmation, so I expected to have so many. What I didn't expect was that a good number of their photos seemed really artistic. So I decided to select the very best ones and compile them into an online art collection. 

I present to you, dear reader, The Dashing Door.


##### *Note: With the exception of cropping to preserve some anonymity, these photos are otherwise in their original forms and orientation.*

A Subway order delicately hanging from my mailbox. The muted background colors give way to the vibrant, revamped Subway logo.

By utilizing a large depth of field to flatten the image, this piece argues against the efficacy of our man-made boundaries.

This piece depicts an unmarked brown bag with an underpinning of insanity achieved through the orientation and unorthodox black borders.

As much as this post is one overly long joke, writing this actually did help me realize the amount of work that goes into online art collections. Writing thoughtful descriptions gave me a lot of trouble \-\- and this was only parody! Even things like page formatting and vetting the pieces were more difficult than I anticipated. My genuine respect goes out to those of you who make *actual* online art collections a reality. You play the woefully undervalued role of promoting the arts in our society and I truly appreciate that now more than ever. 

For those curious, I referenced online pieces from the [MoMA website](https://www.moma.org/), which you should definitely visit. If you enjoyed, feel free to [subscribe](https://tinyletter.com/bhernandev) for email updates on my latest posts. Thanks so much for reading!
