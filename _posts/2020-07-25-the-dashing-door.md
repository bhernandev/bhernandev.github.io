Since the Covid-19 outbreak started, I've become quite the doordash power user and I noticed that my text messages were absolutely filled with photos from my doordash drivers. Now, for the uninitiated, some doordash drivers will text you a picture of your delivered order as a form of confirmation, so this was to be expected after \~5 months of regular use. What I didn't expect was that some of their photos were actually weirdly artistic and evocative. So, I took it upon myself to select the very best ones and compile them into an online art gallery for your viewing pleasure. 

I present to you: The Dashing Door


##### *Note: With the exception of cropping to preserve some anonymity, these photos are otherwise in their original forms and orientation.*

A photo of a Subway order hanging from my mailbox. The muted colors of the background give off a dystopian vibe and contrast with the vibrant colors of the revamped Subway logo.

Taken from behind my front gate. The large depth of field flattens the image and shortens the distance from the gate to the front door.

This piece depicts an unmarked brown bag with an underpinning of insanity achieved through the orientation and unorthodox black borders.

Deliberately taken above the fencing of my home, this piece both celebrates and playfully challenges the rule of thirds.

As much as this post is one overly long joke, it actually did help me realize how much work goes into online art exhibitions. Trying to write thoughtful descriptions gave me a lot of trouble \-\- and this was only parody! Even things like page formatting and selecting the pieces were more difficult than I anticipated. My genuine respect goes out to those of you who make *actual* online art exhibitions a reality. You play the woefully underappreciated role of promoting the arts in our society. For those curious, I referenced online pieces from the MoMA website and you should definitely check them out.

Thanks so much for reading!
